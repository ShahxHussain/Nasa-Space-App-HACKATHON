## Introduction 🌍

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. Among these goals, **SDG 5: Gender Equality** and **SDG 13: Climate Action** are crucial. This project aims to explore the intersection of climate change and gender inequality, showcasing how these issues are interlinked and proposing solutions that promote equality and sustainable development for all.


## Problem Statement & Solution 🛠️

**Challenge:** Climate refugees face increasing vulnerability due to the lack of legal recognition, insecure living conditions, and inadequate access to resources. Gender inequality worsens these challenges, as women disproportionately bear the brunt of climate-related displacement. Our project addresses the need for a global solution that bridges gender equity with climate action.

### Objectives 🎯

**Harmony Heroes** creates an interactive website that not only models the intersection of gender inequality and climate displacement but also provides resources and real-time support to affected individuals. It incorporates a 3D visualization of climate refugee data, mentorship programs, healthcare support, and partnerships for distributing essential hygiene products to women refugees.

### Proposed Solutions 💡

**Harmony Heroes** creates an interactive website that not only models the intersection of gender inequality and climate displacement but also provides resources and real-time support to affected individuals.
